I want to share my improvements in Thunar file manager. I made them for myself for the convenience of everyday work. I'm a civil engineer, not a programmer. But it turned out well. Using the set of my Thunar custom actions, you can not go to the menu Whisker. Here you will find scripts that can compress an image, PDF or DOCX file by 50 to 90%, or make images suitable for OCR, etc. Hopefully this will help to someone with routine office and engineering work. In scripts, part of the text is written in Russian. You can easily translate this text with any online translator.
File uca.xml is my thunar config. To make it work, you need to put it in the ~/.config/Thunar/ directory, and the files from the /bin directory in the ~/.local/bin/ directory on your computer. You also need to install the utilities that some of the scripts are based on. Some of the scripts (50%) are based on linux utilities that are usually installed on your system.
