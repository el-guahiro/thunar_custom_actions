I want to share my improvements in Thunar file manager. I made them for myself for the convenience of everyday work. I'm a civil engineer, not a programmer. But it turned out well. Using the set of my Thunar custom actions, you can not go to the menu Whisker. Hopefully this will help to someone with routine office and engineering work.
